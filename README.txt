Amnis is a web application that uses Google's Cloud Natural Language Processing API to process audio from live webcasts and generate tags for the video. These tags can then be searched by users to find live videos on subjects they are interested in. In addition, the page has a live comment box where viewers can ask questions or upvote questions that they find relevant. The webcaster can then view the top questions and answer them.
